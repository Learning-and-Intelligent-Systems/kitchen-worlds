Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. You can install MkDocs using pip or other package manager. Install with pip # If you use the Python package manager, pip , then you can: $ pip install --upgrade pip $ pip install mkdocs To check that it is installed: $ mkdocs --version mkdocs, version version 1.2.2 from ... Install with a Package Manager # If you prefer useing another package manager (such as apt-get , dnf , homebrew , yum , chocolatey , etc.) to install packages on your system, then you may install MkDocs with your package manager. Step 2: Start MkDocs Server # MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the mkdocs serve command: $ mkdocs serve INFO - Building documentation...

Now you can view the documentation site in http://127.0.0.1:8000/ , being updated in real time as you save your edits to the files. Step 3: Edit Pages # Before you make changes to the documentation, make sure to git pull the latest changes made by others to avoid conflict. Add a page # If you want to add a page to the wiki, reate a new markdown file in the docs/ directory. Then, add its name and markdown file name to mkdocs.yml , where you will see: nav: - Genesis: - Genesis System: index.md - Contribute to Documentation: mkdocs.md - Representation: - Inner Language - Innerese: innerese.md - ... - Fundamentals: - Inference by Rules: inference.md - ... - The current hierarchy and order is designed so that a new student can use the documentation as a tutorial. Major reorganization is possible upon discussion with Yang : Write in Markdown # Our wiki pages are written in Markdown , a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The following cheatsheet designed by Theme Spectre showed the most frequently used syntax: To make it even easier to write in Markdown, you can add Markdown plugin to your editor.
